This project defines a Gondola class in Java that models the features and behavior of a gondola boat, like those traditionally used in Venice. It includes properties such as name, size, material, occupancy limits, lifespan, speed, and current passenger count. The program demonstrates object-oriented principles including constructors, getters/setters, and behavior methods.
